ii. Application overview:

    The application module has the responsibility of pushing server sent events to the clients about the registration of the 
    contestants for the bengaluru idol singing competition. The module is to be part of the microservices architecture based
    application allowing users to register for the event.
    The end users benefitting from the module are the organizers that will be able to check registration metrics based on the 
    age of the contestant.
    Not included in the scope of this module is the registration of the candidates which would be a separate spring application module
    serving the purpose of candidate registration and producing kafka message about the contestant to the topic that will be consumed 
    by this application module to calculate the metrics.

    The application uses kafka streams for stream processing the topics that registration module will produce.

    The SSE endpoint will be dashboard/stream/groups.
